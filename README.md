# PersonalStravaAnalysis
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of my personal athletic data obtained from Strava to gain insights into my training habits and performance trends. Using Excel for initial data cleaning and preprocessing, I organized and structured the data to facilitate detailed analysis. I then utilized Power BI to create interactive dashboards that visualize key metrics such as training volume per year, activity frequency, performance improvements, and other relevant statistics.
